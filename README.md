# Building Physical Access Managemen Patents
This repository contains a list of my patents in the field of physical access management.

The central premise of this physical access management architecture is to leverage the power of 
blockchain distributed ledger technology, an identity wallet, and an individual's unique identity 
(such as a device, wearable, or biometric) to facilitate secure and efficient building operations. 
This innovative approach ensures robust identity verification while safeguarding the privacy of 
personally identifiable information.
